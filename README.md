# UserDirectory

## Overview

This app is an employee directory using React. The components have been broken into parts,
to be combined on a one page app.

## User Story

- As a user, I want quick access to all the people in my company.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to be able to filter employees by name.

## Functionality

Given a table of users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders when a name is searched.

The user is able to:

- Sort the table by name.

- Filter the users by at least one property.
